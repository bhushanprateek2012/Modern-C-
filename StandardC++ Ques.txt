The main ones that you need to explore in the context of "fast and efficient" are:
-- constexpr
-- Move semantics and rvalue references
-- Templates metaprogramming and variadic templates
-- smart pointers
-- Standardization of STL library and algorithms
-- introducing thread library as part of STL
-- auto type deduction and uniform initialization..
